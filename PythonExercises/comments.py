# Comments are ussed to describe what each part of your code does.
# it's important when your code is more than one line
# To sum up comments are used to describe our programme
# This '#' is used for stating a comment 7 they are ignored by python

# for ex below is to print hello world
print("hello world")

# Similarly, there is multi-line comment
# Used when we want to comment mutiple line at once
# Here is an example of multi-line comment
"""
print("I")
print("am")
"""
print("Tanmay")
print("Kumar")
print("Rout")
# But if we don't use the second occurrence of triple quote'"""',
#It will consider all the rest of the codes after the first occurrance as comment, so be careful
